# 1) To make Homebrew work, put it at the front of the path
# so brew packages are used over Mac OS defaults (e.g. git)
# 2) global NPM packages (e.g. Grunt, Yeoman)
# 3) rbenv (ruby versions & their associated gems)
# 4) Scripted app (NB: Mac only)
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$(rbenv prefix)/bin:/Applications/Scripted/bin:$PATH"
